Home Touch is a user authenitcating pipeline that allows an IOT ecosystem to access the personal preferences of several
users all through the same device. Using an Amazon Echo and a Synaptics fingerprint scanner, we use biometric data to characterize 
unique users and update a SmartHome's current settings with the help of Amazon's API. With HomeTouch, your unique SmartHome experience
is only a touch away!
